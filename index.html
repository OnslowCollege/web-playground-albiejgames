      <h2>Welcome</h2>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>RADOTHEGOAT</strong>, an aspiring YouTuber born in Papua
        New Guinea. My dream is to grow from humble beginnings into a global
        creator who inspires others to follow their passions—no matter where
        they come from.

      <h2>Why I Do This</h2>
      <p>
        Growing up in a remote part of Papua New Guinea, I didn’t have many
        resources or examples of creators. But I always believed that with
        creativity, determination, and hard work, I could build something
        meaningful. My YouTube channel is more than just videos—it’s a journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through my content, I share my daily life, my struggles, and my small
        triumphs. I want viewers around the world to not just watch me, but
        connect, resonate, and feel empowered to chase their own dreams.

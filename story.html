        RADOTHEGOAT was born in a small village deep within the lush jungles of Papua New Guinea. Growing up,
        he didn’t have access to much technology — but whenever a phone found its way to the village,
        RADO would borrow it just long enough to watch YouTube. Those rare moments inspired a dream inside him:
        he wanted to create videos that would reach the world beyond the mountains he called home.
        <br><br>
        With limited resources, RADO began filming using old, donated smartphones and editing on borrowed laptops.
        Many people doubted him. Some laughed. But RADO pushed forward, determined to show the world
        that greatness can come from anywhere — even from the most remote corners of Papua New Guinea.
        <br><br>
        Today, his journey is only beginning. His videos capture not only his humor and creativity but also
        the vibrant spirit of the place he grew up in.

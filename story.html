    <p>
      Born and raised in Papua New Guinea, RADOTHEGOAT grew up surrounded by nature, culture, and a deep love for storytelling.
      His dream began in a small village, with limited access to technology—but unlimited imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through persistence and passion, RADOTHEGOAT learned to edit, record, and share his life with the world. 
      Every video represents his belief that no dream is too big, no matter where you start.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mission? To inspire millions to never give up and to prove that greatness can come from anywhere.

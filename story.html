      <h2>Roots in Papua New Guinea</h2>
      <p>
        I was born in a small village in Papua New Guinea. My early life was
        simple: limited electricity, no high-end gear, and only bits of the
        outside world coming in through a small radio or the rare trip to
        town.
      </p>

      <p>
        But that environment shaped me. It taught me resourcefulness. It taught
        me creativity. It taught me to dream.

      <h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
      <p>
        Getting into content creation wasn’t easy. My internet was often
        unstable, my equipment was basic, and many around me didn’t understand
        why I was doing this. But I believed in a vision: telling stories,
        connecting with people, and building something bigger than my
        surroundings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spent countless hours learning video editing, practising with what I
        had, and using free tools when I could. There were days when progress
        felt impossible—but those were the days I doubled down.

        Through photos, I share moments of learning, of hardship, and of joy.
        From the first video camera to milestone celebrations, each frame tells
        a part of the story.

      <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
      <p>
        My goal is to become the world’s biggest YouTuber. Not just in
        subscribers, but in heart: to connect with people, to build community,
        and to inspire. I know it’s a huge dream — but what’s life without big
        dreams?
      </p>
      <p>
        With every upload, I try to improve. With every setback, I try to learn.
        And most importantly, I keep believing that where I come from is not a
        limit — it's the foundation.
